Assume the days of current year is numbered 1 to 365.
A Coverage is defined as range of dates with a coverage start and end/term date. Eg: Cov(1, 30) means the person is
covered for something for Jan of this year.

Problem: Given a series of coverage data for a person, we need to find the
longest continuous coverage. The coverage may have overlap and/or gaps in coverage.
